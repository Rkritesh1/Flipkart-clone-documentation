Flipkart Clone Documentation 
1. Project Overview 
The Flipkart Clone is a full-stack e-commerce web application that replicates key 
functionalities of the Flipkart platform. The project aims to provide a seamless online 
shopping experience, featuring product listings, user authentication, shopping cart 
functionality, secure checkout, and an admin panel for managing products and orders. 
This clone is built using React.js for the frontend to ensure a dynamic and responsive user 
interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling business logic and 
API requests efficiently. MongoDB is used as the database to store user details, product 
information, orders, and cart data. 
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring a well
structured and scalable codebase. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web 
Tokens) to provide secure user login and registration. Payments can be integrated using 
Stripe or PayPal, enabling a real-world e-commerce experience. 
The Flipkart Clone is designed with a focus on scalability, ensuring that new features such as 
reviews, recommendations, and enhanced security can be added in future updates. This 
project serves as a learning tool for full-stack development while also being a functional 
prototype for an e-commerce platform.
